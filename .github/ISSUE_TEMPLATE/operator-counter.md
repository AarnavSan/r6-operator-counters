- Operator being countered: [e.g. Valkyrie, Kapkan]

**Do you think the community would agree with this information?**
The graph is made less readable when more information is added to it. Are you sure this is a worthwhile change? [e.g. "I've not played Rainbow Six Siege that much but I'm 90% sure this operator counters this other operator. You should check with another more experienced player to make sure I'm right."]
